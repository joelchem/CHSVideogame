# CHS Videogame

A hallway obstacle-racing game where you sprint to the cafeteria, dodge classmates, and grab power-ups to boost your speed — all in the name of lunch.

## 🎮 About the Game

**CHS Videogame** is a fast-paced hallway runner set in Centennial High School. Players race through crowded halls, avoiding obstacles and collecting power-ups to reach the cafeteria as quickly as possible.

## 🧠 Project Background

This game was developed as the final project for our **Advanced Object-Oriented Design** course in high school. We were placed in a team of 10 students and followed real-world software development methodologies, including:

- 🧩 **Agile Development**
- 🔁 **Frequent Standups** with our teacher (acting as the client)
- 🗂️ **Collaborative Planning** and task delegation
